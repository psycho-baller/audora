## üéØ What is Audora?

Audora is a **speech reflection app** that helps you become a better communicator. It:

- **Records conversations** with your consent and the other person's consent
- **Transcribes** what was said using AI
- **Analyzes** your speech patterns (filler words, pacing, clarity, confidence)
- **Provides feedback** to help you improve your communication skills
- **Remembers** key facts about your conversations and relationships

Think of it as a personal communication coach that helps you "maxx out how you link" with others!

## üß† Understanding the Tech Stack

Before diving in, let's understand what technologies this project uses:

### **Monorepo Structure**

This project uses a "monorepo" - one repository containing multiple related projects:

- **Web app** (runs in browser)
- **Mobile app** (runs on iOS/Android)
- **Backend** (Convex functions)
- **Shared packages** (code used by both apps)

### **Key Technologies**

#### **Frontend (What Users See)**

1. **React** (Web)
   - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
   - Think of it as building blocks for websites
   - Official docs: <https://react.dev/>

2. **React Native** (Mobile)
   - Like React, but for mobile apps
   - Write once, run on iOS and Android
   - Official docs: <https://reactnative.dev/>

3. **Expo** (Mobile Development Platform)
   - Makes React Native development easier
   - Provides tools and services for mobile apps
   - Official docs: <https://docs.expo.dev/>

4. **React Router v7** (Web Navigation)
   - Handles navigation between pages on the web app
   - Official docs: <https://reactrouter.com/>

5. **TailwindCSS** (Styling)
   - A utility-first CSS framework for styling
   - Makes it easy to create beautiful UIs
   - Official docs: <https://tailwindcss.com/>

#### **Backend (What Happens Behind the Scenes)**

1. **Convex** (Backend Platform)
   - A backend-as-a-service platform
   - Handles database, real-time updates, and server functions
   - No need to manage servers yourself!
   - Official docs: <https://docs.convex.dev/>

2. **Clerk** (Authentication)
   - Handles user login, signup, and security
   - Provides ready-made UI components
   - Official docs: <https://clerk.com/docs>

#### **AI Services**

1. **OpenAI Whisper** (Speech-to-Text)
   - Converts audio recordings to text
   - Very accurate transcription

2. **OpenAI GPT-5** (Analysis)
   - Analyzes conversations
   - Extracts facts and insights

3. **Speechmatics** (Real-time Transcription)
   - Transcribes speech in real-time
   - Identifies different speakers

#### **Build Tools**

1. **Turborepo** (Monorepo Management)
   - Manages multiple projects in one repository
   - Makes builds faster with caching

2. **pnpm** (Package Manager)
   - Installs and manages dependencies
   - Faster and more efficient than npm

## üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Navigate to where you want the project
cd ~/Documents/code

# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd audora
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

This will install all the packages needed for the project:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This might take a few minutes. You'll see a lot of text scrolling - that's normal!

### Step 3: Set Up Convex (Backend)

Convex is your backend database and API. Let's set it up:

```bash
# Install Convex CLI globally
npm install -g convex

# Login to Convex (opens browser)
npx convex login

# Initialize Convex in the backend package
cd packages/backend
npx convex dev
```

This will:

- Create a new Convex project
- Generate a deployment URL
- Start watching for changes

**Important**: Keep this terminal window open! Copy the `CONVEX_URL` that appears - you'll need it next.

### Step 4: Set Up Clerk (Authentication)

1. Go to <https://clerk.com/> and sign up
2. Create a new application
3. Choose "Email" and "Google" as sign-in methods
4. Copy your **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**

### Step 5: Configure Environment Variables

You need to create configuration files that tell the apps where to find your services.

#### For the Web App

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
```

Then edit `apps/web/.env.local` with your actual values:

```env
VITE_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
VITE_CLERK_FRONTEND_API_URL=https://your-clerk-frontend-api.clerk.accounts.dev

CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
```

**Note**: See `apps/web/.env.example` for all required variables.

#### For the Mobile App

Copy the example file and fill in your values:

```bash
cp apps/expo/.env.example apps/expo/.env.local
```

Then edit `apps/expo/.env.local` with your actual values:

```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-deployment.convex.cloud
EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_xxxxx
```

**Note**: Mobile apps use `EXPO_PUBLIC_` prefix for environment variables.

#### For the Backend

The backend needs API keys set in Convex environment. See `packages/backend/.env.example` for all available variables.

Set the required API keys:

```bash
cd packages/backend

# Set OpenAI API key
npx convex env set OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-xxxxx"

# Set Speechmatics API key (optional)
npx convex env set SPEECHMATICS_API_KEY "your_key"

# Set Zep API key (optional, for knowledge graph)
npx convex env set ZEP_API_KEY "your_zep_key"
npx convex env set ZEP_GRAPH_ID "your_graph_id"

# Set VAPI keys (optional, for voice calls)
npx convex env set VAPI_API_KEY "your_vapi_key"
npx convex env set VAPI_PHONE_NUMBER_ID "your_phone_number_id"
npx convex env set VAPI_WORKFLOW_ID "your_workflow_id"
```

**Note**: Only `OPENAI_API_KEY` is required. Other keys are optional depending on which features you want to use.

### Step 6: Configure Clerk with Convex

You need to connect Clerk to Convex:

1. In your Clerk dashboard, go to **JWT Templates**
2. Create a new template called "convex"
3. Copy the JWKS endpoint URL
4. In your Convex dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Authentication**
5. Add Clerk as an authentication provider using the JWKS URL

## üèÉ Running the Project

Now you're ready to run the project!

### Option 1: Run Everything at Once

From the root directory:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This starts:

- Web app at `http://localhost:5173`
- Mobile app (Expo)
- Backend (Convex)

### Option 2: Run Individual Apps

You can run each app separately:

#### Run Web App Only

```bash
pnpm dev:web
```

Then open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

#### Run Mobile App Only

```bash
pnpm dev:expo
```

Then:

- Scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your phone, OR
- Press `i` for iOS simulator, OR
- Press `a` for Android emulator

#### Run Backend Only

```bash
pnpm dev:backend
```
